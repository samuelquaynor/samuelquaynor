<summary><b>üí≠ Inspiration</b></summary>

I put myself in the shoes of whoever I want to catch the attention of - hiring managers, collaborators, mentors, investors. I asked myself: *"What questions would I actually be looking to have answered about this person?"*

The fundamental insight hit me: **If you don't know the questions people are really asking, you'll answer the wrong ones.**

Traditional CVs are forced to be concise - they compress years of learning, problem-solving, and growth into bullet points that barely scratch the surface. They list skills, technologies, and achievements - and yes, these matter. But they're just checkboxes. They're common, learnable, and don't make you stand out. What makes someone special isn't their ability to use React or Python - it's their creativity, their unique approach to problems, their way of thinking.

**This README goes beyond the checklist.** It shows not just what I can do, but how I think, what drives me, and what makes my approach unique.

### Why Not a Portfolio Website?

As engineers, we're engrossed in solving real-world problems. Building and maintaining an entire portfolio website often feels like over-engineering - it's a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist. This README serves the same purpose more efficiently, with zero maintenance overhead and maximum accessibility.

**One-stop solution:** Everything is in one place. No switching between tabs, no navigating through multiple pages, no waiting for different sections to load. Your entire portfolio, code samples, and story are accessible in a single scroll. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution.

## üëã Who am I
I'm a passionate engineer who loves solving complex problems and building innovative solutions. My engineering journey has been driven by curiosity, systematic thinking, and a desire to create meaningful impact through technology.

I've had the privilege of working across the full spectrum of engineering environments - from corporate structures to startup agility, from team collaboration to solo entrepreneurship. This diversity has given me a unique perspective on how different approaches can solve the same problems.

**Environments I've Thrived In:**
- **Corporate Engineering** - Large-scale systems, structured processes, cross-functional collaboration
- **Startup Engineering** - Rapid iteration, resource constraints, high-impact decisions
- **Solo Entrepreneurship** - End-to-end ownership, strategic thinking, market validation

My experience spans the entire software development lifecycle, allowing me to understand problems from multiple perspectives and build more effective solutions.

**Roles I've Worked In:**
- **Backend Engineering** - APIs, databases, system architecture
- **Frontend Engineering** - User experience, interface design, client-side optimization
- **Full-Stack Engineering** - End-to-end development, system integration
- **Mobile Engineering** - Cross-platform app development
- **Software Engineering** - System design, architecture, and scalable solutions
- **Automation Engineering** - Process optimization, efficiency improvements
- **Data Engineering** - Modern data pipelines, analytics, and reporting systems
- **DevOps Engineering** - CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, cloud deployment, and operational excellence


## üöÄ Current Solutions I'm Working On
I'm currently working on multiple projects that challenge me in different ways and help me grow as an engineer.

### Data Team Workflow Transformation
*Engineering a complete overhaul of our data team's operational model to transform chaotic, ad-hoc processes into a predictable, high-quality operation.
