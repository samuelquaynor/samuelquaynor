# An Actual READ ME

## 💭 Why This README Exists

I put myself in the shoes of whoever I want to catch the attention of - hiring managers, collaborators, mentors, investors. I asked myself: *"What questions would I actually be looking to have answered about this person?"*

The fundamental insight hit me: **If you don't know the questions people are really asking, you'll answer the wrong ones.**

Traditional CVs are forced to be concise - they compress years of learning, problem-solving, and growth into bullet points that barely scratch the surface. They list skills, technologies, and achievements - and yes, these matter. But they're just checkboxes. They're common, learnable, and don't make you stand out. What makes someone special isn't their ability to use React or Python - it's their creativity, their unique approach to problems, their way of thinking.

**This README goes beyond the checklist.** It shows not just what I can do, but how I think, what drives me, and what makes my approach unique.

### Why Not a Portfolio Website?

As engineers, we're engrossed in solving real-world problems. Building and maintaining an entire portfolio website often feels like over-engineering - it's a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist. This README serves the same purpose more efficiently, with zero maintenance overhead and maximum accessibility.

**One-stop solution:** Everything is in one place. No switching between tabs, no navigating through multiple pages, no waiting for different sections to load. Your entire portfolio, code samples, and story are accessible in a single scroll. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution.
